          The optomechanics research community emerged as a product of the great
          scientific effort to directly observe a gravitational wave propagating
          through earth and altering the relative length between the arms of a
          giant Michelson interferometer
					<a href=https://journals.aps.org/prl/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.061102>[1]</a>.
					This effort commenced in the early 80's
          when theoreticians like Caves and Braginsky
					[<a href=https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.45.75>2</a>,
					<a href=https://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Measurement-Vladimir-B-Braginsky/dp/0521484138>3</a>] posed the question
          that defined the mission of optomechanics:
          “can such a measurement be infinitely precise?”.
			</p>
			<p>
					Since then, several
					research groups started experimental activities to test the fundamental
					limits associated to this measurement. One of these groups, led by
					optomechanics pioneer A. Heidmann, developed in the late 90's a
					table-top optical experiment to simulate in the laboratory the
					experimental conditions of a gravitational antenna. I received my
					training as an experimentalist in his group in the prestigious
					Laboratoire Kastler Brossel (Paris), where I produced my Doctoral
					thesis [<a href=https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-00813308/document>4</a>].
					The experiment was based on a high-finesse optical cavity
					and a pump-probe experimental scheme, combined with a state-of-the-art
					detection system which until today holds the record of the most accurate
					displacement measurement  [<a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/0809.2510.pdf>5</a>].
					There, I focused my efforts in
					observing radiation pressure effects onto the cavity's movable mirror,
					at room temperature, which constitutes one of the fundamental quantum
					noises that will be limiting the next generation of gravitational antennas.
					I learned the use of all the experimental tools of quantum optics
					(optical cavities, homodyne detections etc.) and I obtained a high
					proficiency in analog feedback protocols used to actively stabilise
					the experiment.

      <h2>From macro-resonators to nano-resonators</h2>

      <p>
        The technological advances in the fabrication of nano structures offered to the optomechanics
        community an additional boost. By increasingly reducing the dimensions of the movable object
        -thus making it lighter- quantum optomechanical effects became more easily measurable.
        This led me to take up the next challenge in my academic career at the Barcelona-based Institut
        of Photonics Sciences - ICFO Barcelona, where I developed novel experimental techniques to
        measure the tinniest existing resonator: a suspended carbon nanotube (CNT). To succeed this goal,
        I developed and used two different experimental platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Firstly, I mounted a novel experimental s
        etup based on a tightly focused laser beam and a sensitive avalanche photodetector.
        A robust nano-engineering protocol enabled the accurate deposition of a
        metallic nano particle on the edge of the CNT assuring a detectable
        amount of scattering photons and providing a spectacular signal-to-noise
        ratio (> 30 dB) at room temperature. The stability of this platform
        permitted the study of cavity-free dynamical back-action effects,
        the resonator non-linear effects and the closed-loop manipulation of
        the resonator (frequency noise cancellation, cold damping, etc.) [8].
      </p>
      <p>
        Secondly, I have used a focused electron beam provided by a commercial Scanning Electron
        Microscope (SEM) to perform real time measurements of carbon nanotube resonators.
        This technique permitted for the first time the extraction of the complete information
        on the dynamics of the motion of a carbon nanotube (i.e. the amplitude and phase).
        With careful experimental manipulation the complete motion of the carbon nanotube was
        reconstructed in real space while with the use of an active feedback scheme was implemented
        to assure real-time tracking of the frequency thus making it the first demonstration of mass
        sensing using a carbon nanotube resonator at room temperature [9].

        A suspended carbon nanotube in combination with a metallic nano particle is a promising hybridised
      	nano optomechanical system; it may combine the measurement purity of cavity optomechanics with all
      	the advantages by a nano-mechanical system. Its extreme light mass (~ ag) makes it an ideal candidate
      	to be used as a probe for fundamental forces (radiation pressure) but also for sensor-based applications
      	(force/acceleration/mass sensor). In my next career steps, I plan to use this system for both
      	fundamental studies and application-oriented development.
